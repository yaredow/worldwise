# WorldWise

WorldWise is a travel tracking and adventure registration application. Its main purpose is to allow users to register and keep track of the places they have traveled to, providing them with a visual representation of their adventures on a map.

## Features

- Interactive maps powered by [Leaflet], a JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
- Adventure Registration: Users can fill out a form to register the cities they have visited. The form likely includes fields such as city name, date of visit, and any additional details they wish to provide.
- Map Visualization: The app incorporates a map component that displays markers for each registered city the user has visited. Clicking on a marker provides more information about the city and the user's adventure there.
- Context API for managing global state and theme.
- Custom hooks for encapsulating logic and reusing functionality.
- React Router for navigation and routing.
